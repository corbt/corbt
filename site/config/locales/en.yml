# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

              Welcome friends!

              As we prepare for our upcoming life together there's nothing that makes us happier than celebrating it with all of you. Although many of you are scattered throughout the world (an unfortunate byproduct of our all-to-international courtship and backstory), we hope that as many as possible will find a way to attend one of the three receptions listed below.

              Our international adventures aren't yet over!  After our marriage in Salt Lake City, we'll be moving straight to London, where Karla is currently working towards a PhD at Queen Mary, University of London.  Since we'll only be there a short time (18 months or so) and shipping across the Atlantic is expensive, we've decided to register a few things on [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wedding/227K0MTZADSEO) and some bulkier or longer-term items on [Amazon USA](http://amazon.com/registry/wedding/114REP8G6W4OJ). Of course, your presence at our reception is what we care about most.

              With love,

              Kyle and Karla

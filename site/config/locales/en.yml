# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

              Welcome friends!

              As we prepare for our upcoming life together there's nothing that makes us happier than celebrating it with all of you. Although many of you are scattered throughout the world (a byproduct of our all-to-international story), we hope that as many as possible will find a way to attend one of the three receptions listed below.

              Our overseas adventures aren't yet over!  After our marriage in Salt Lake City, we'll be moving straight to London, where Karla is currently working towards a PhD at Queen Mary, University of London.  Since we'll only be there a short time (18 months or so), we've decided to register with [Amazon](http://amazon.com/registry/wedding/114REP8G6W4OJ) and keep most of the gifts we receive in storage in the US for now. Of course, your presence at our reception is what we care about most.

              With love,

              Kyle and Karla
